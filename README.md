DIABETIC RETINOPATHY DETECTION MODEL

OVERVIEW

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting diabetic retinopathy from fundus images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and can lead to vision loss if not detected and treated early. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a dataset of fundus images to classify images as either normal or showing signs of diabetic retinopathy.

FEATURES

Trained using a dataset of fundus images labeled with diabetic retinopathy status.

Utilizes state-of-the-art CNN architecture for image classification.

Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and abnormal fundus images.

Easy to use and integrate into existing healthcare systems for diabetic retinopathy screening.



USAGE

Model Training: Train the model using the provided dataset of fundus images.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess accuracy and other metrics.

Deployment: Integrate the trained model into healthcare systems for automated diabetic retinopathy screening.


REQUIREMENTS
